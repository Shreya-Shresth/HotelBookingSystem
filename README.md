JAVA|JDBC|Mysql
This project demonstrates how to connect a Java application to a MySQL database using Maven. You can easily manage dependencies via the pom.xml file, eliminating the need to manually add JAR files to your build path.

Prerequisites
JDK 8 or later installed
Maven installed
MySQL database
MySQL JDBC Driver (added via Maven)
Setting Up the Project
Clone the repository (or create a Maven project manually):

bash
Copy code
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd your-project-directory
Configure the pom.xml:

Open the pom.xml file and add the MySQL connector dependency in the <dependencies> section:

xml
Copy code
<dependencies>
    <!-- MySQL Connector Java -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>mysql</groupId>
        <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
        <version>8.0.33</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
This ensures that Maven will automatically download the required MySQL JDBC driver.

Database Setup:

Ensure you have a running MySQL instance. Create a database and note the following details:

Database name
Username
Password
Host (typically localhost)
Port (default 3306)
Update these details in the connection code within the App.java file.

Running the Application:

To run the application, use Maven commands:

Compile the project:

bash
Copy code
mvn compile
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="your.package.App"
Note: Ensure that the App.java class contains the correct main method and database connection logic.

Notes:
Replace yourDatabase, yourUsername, and yourPassword with your actual MySQL credentials.
Adjust the SQL insert query based on your table structure.

Common Issues
Connection Errors: Ensure that your MySQL service is running and the credentials are correct.
Port Conflicts: MySQL by default runs on port 3306. If you're using a different port, update the JDBC URL accordingly.
This README includes instructions on setting up Maven, adding the MySQL connector, and running the application. You can modify the database connection details and the SQL queries as needed for your project.
